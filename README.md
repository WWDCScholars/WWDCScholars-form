We are currently working on our new website and app for WWDCScholars. 

Website: https://github.com/WWDCScholars/WWDC-Scholars-Web-2015

iOS App: https://github.com/WWDCScholars/WWDCScholars-iOS

We have bold plans this year including consolidating all the previous batches of scholars known as WWDCStudents and add in the upcoming scholars of 2016 and more to our website and app.
